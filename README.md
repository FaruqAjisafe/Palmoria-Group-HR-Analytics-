Workforce Equity and Compliance Analysis: 2025 Strategic Audit

Analyst: Faruq Olalekan Ajisafe

Tools Used: Power BI, DAX, Power Query, Microsoft PowerPoint
📋 Project Overview & Background

Palmoria Group is entering a critical fiscal year in 2025, requiring total transparency in human capital management. The organization faces two primary challenges: unverified internal claims of a "Patriarchy" (gender-based pay bias) and a new regulatory mandate requiring a minimum annual salary floor of $90,000.

As an independent analyst, I conducted this audit to provide a data-driven foundation for executive decision-making. By cleaning and analyzing thousands of data points, I have identified the specific financial and legal risks the company faces, separating rumors from reality.
⚠️ Problem Statement

Palmoria Group is currently at high risk of legal non-compliance. A significant portion of the workforce earns below the mandatory $90,000 threshold, creating an immediate threat of regulatory penalties in 2025. Additionally, perceived gender pay gaps are damaging internal morale. Without this audited analysis, the company lacked the precise financial data needed to calculate the cost of fixing these gaps or to address the "Patriarchy" claims with evidence.
🎯 Project Objectives (Expectations)

    Achieve Legal Compliance: Identify every employee and region in breach of the $90,000 salary law.

    Audit Gender Equity: Compare male and female pay across identical roles to determine if systemic bias exists.

    Financial Forecasting: Calculate the exact Bonus Pool required to bring the entire organization into 100% compliance.

    Executive Visualization: Deliver an interactive, Navy-themed dashboard for real-time monitoring of HR metrics.

🛠️ Data Methodology

To ensure 100% accuracy, I followed a rigorous "painstaking" technical process:

    Cleaning & Transformation: Managed null values, corrected regional naming errors (e.g., standardizing Lagos/Abuja), and ensured strict data type formatting for modeling.

    DAX Engineering: Built custom measures for complex KPIs, including Bonus Payouts, Compliance Ratios, and Gender Pay Gap variances.

    UI/UX Design: Implemented a high-contrast Navy and Gold "C-Suite" theme to ensure the dashboard is professional, aesthetic, and easy for executives to navigate.

📊 Key Insights

    The Compliance Gap: 77% of the workforce currently earns below the legal minimum of $90,000.

    The "Patriarchy" Check: While gender distribution is relatively balanced (524 Females vs. 476 Males), the audit identified specific regions where pay disparities exist.

    Financial Cost: A total budget of $11,967,364 is required in bonuses/adjustments to reach full compliance.

💡 Recommendations

    Immediate Salary Normalization: Raise all employees below the $90k floor to avoid 2025 legal fines.

    Standardized Pay Scale: Transition to a performance-based pay system to eliminate gender bias risks.

    Regional Prioritization: Focus immediate HR interventions on high-risk regions identified in the dashboard (Lagos/Abuja).
